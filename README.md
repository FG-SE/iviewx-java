The **iviewx-java** library is a Java adapter for the SMI IView X SDK.

The library consists of two parts:

The **[iviewx-java/core][1]** library contains classes and interfaces
that allow fetching and stabilization of chronologically ordered data
from sources that provide a conforming receiver. The core library
also offers services for asynchronous data recording and integration
with **[RxJava][2]**.

The **[iviewx-java/iviewx][3]** library contains the adapter to the SMI
IView X SDK, the receivers and data types to integrate with the core
library, and serialization functionality for storing or transmitting
eyetracking data.

## Getting started ##

The following instructions will get you up and running with the
**iviewx-java** library.

### Prerequisites ###

* Java 1.8 or higher
* IView X SDK 4.2 or higher
* IView X Eyetracking Server
* The SDK `/bin` folder in your PATH environment variable

**Note:** The library has been tested with the SMI Red-m Eye Tracker
          and the IView X SDK 4.2. Other models and SDK versions might
          fail to run, or need a few tweaks to the SDK adapter. See the
          developer section of the User Guide for further information.

### Installation ###

If you are using a build tool, you can add **iviewx-java** as a
dependency.

#### Gradle: ####

```groovy
compile 'de.unihannover.se.iviewxjava:iviewx-java:1.0.0'
```

#### Maven: ####

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>de.unihannover.se.iviewxjava</groupId>
  <artifactId>iviewx-java</artifactId>
  <version>1.0.0</version>
  <type>pom</type>
</dependency>
```

All versions of the library, as well as the  above snippets with
the most recent version inserted, can be found on the projects
[Bintray package site][4].

The library is hosted on JCenter, so make sure to add it as a
repository in your build configuration.

#### Building from Source: ####

If you do not use a build tool, you can also build the project from
source.

Simply clone this repository and run one of the *archives*
Gradle tasks to produce a JAR file, which you can add to
your project.

```bash
# Produces a JAR without the dependencies
gradlew.bat jar

# Produces a fat JAR, containing all of the dependencies
gradlew.bat fatJar
```

**Note:** The use of a build tool for dependency management is advised

## Running the Tests ##

To run the tests for the **iviewx-java** library, clone this repository
and call the *test* Gradle task.

```bash
gradlew.bat test
```

The **iviewx-java** repository is integrated with Travis CI, to
identify failing builds early on.

## Documentation ##

We offer a User Guide, containing detailed information on how to
set up a project with **iviewx-java**, how to work with the library,
code examples, application design advice and developer information.

For a detailed description of all classes and their methods, we
provide a online version of the projects Javadoc.

* **[User Guide (WIP)][5]**
* **[Javadoc][6]**
