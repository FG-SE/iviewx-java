[General]
- Make a list of features that the SDK supports for the RED-m eyetracker, that have not yet been implemented in this library

[Timed Data Retrieval]
- Do we actually need the timed data receivers? Will they be used, or are they just making the library bigger?
- System time can only be measured in milliseconds, is that okay, or do we need a more fine-grained timer?

[Sorted Lists]
- Refactor to remove code duplication

[Sample/Event Loader, Sorted Sample/Event List]
- How big will these lists get?
- Do we have to stream them in/out of a file?
- Do we have to increase the maximum heap size of the JVM at startup?

[ConnectionManager]
- Automatically disconnect from IView X Server if the class is garbage collected
 -> Socket and file handles should be freed by the OS on application shutdown
 -> java.lang.Runtime#addShutdownHook might be useful if there are still any problems with resource cleanup
 
 [Sample-/EventReceiver]
 - Add hasNext() method
