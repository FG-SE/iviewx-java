[General]
- Make a list of features that the SDK supports for the RED-m eyetracker, that have not yet been implemented in this library

[Sorted Lists]
- Refactor to remove code duplication
 -> Implement SortedList<T> that uses Comparable methods to ensure sorting and intelligently append already sorted entries (like before)

[Sample/Event Loader, Sorted Sample/Event List]
- How big will these lists get?
- Do we have to stream them in/out of a file?
- Do we have to increase the maximum heap size of the JVM at startup?

[ConnectionManager]
- Automatically disconnect from IView X Server if the class is garbage collected (probably not needed)
 -> Socket and file handles should be freed by the OS on application shutdown
 -> java.lang.Runtime#addShutdownHook might be useful if there are still any problems with resource cleanup
 
 [Idea]
 - Add startEyetracking() and stopEyetracking() to IViewX
 - Make hasNext() return false from IViewX receivers if the eyetracker is not tracking
