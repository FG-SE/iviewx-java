[Documentation]
- Add @throws tags to methods of eyetracker dependent classes
- Add missing links to mentioned classes

[General]
- Remove functionality that is not supported by the RED-m eyetracker (See section "Function and Device Overview" in the IView X SDK Manual)

[Timed Data Retrieval]
- System time can only be measured in milliseconds, is that okay, or do we need a more fine-grained timer?
