/** List of eyetracking events sorted by their start- and end-timestamps.
 *  <p>
 *  This container guarantees chronological correct order of held eyetracking events. 
 *  Only a subset of the typical Java list interface is provided to prevent the user 
 *  from issuing very performance heavy tasks. However a Iterable interface is implemented for 
 *  easy traversal through the list.
 *  <p>
 *  Make sure, that the eyetracking events, that you add to this container are already 
 *  in order. This has to be because a very crude algorithm is used to maintain chronological 
 *  correctness. Eyetracking events, that do not match the chronological order of insertion are 
 *  simply not inserted but ignored. This is very fast, but may be undesirable if you have a 
 *  unsorted collection of eyetracking events. In that case you will have to sort the eyetracking 
 *  events before adding them to the collection. Since eyetracking event datasets can become quite 
 *  large think about persistently sorting them beforehand.
 *  <p>
 *  Future versions of this library might include other variations of this class, which automate the 
 *  above process. Keep in mind, that sorting the data beforehand will still provide you with the best 
 *  performance.
