/** The central access point to the part of the Eyetracking API which
 *  uses the SMI IView X Server for eyetracking data retrieval.
 *  
 *  The IViewX class provides methods for connecting to the server, calibrating the 
 *  eyetracking device and validating the calibration results. To receive 
 *  eyetracking samples and events there are methods for getting a 
 *  ETSampleReceiver and a ETEventReceiver.
 *  
 *  The interface of this class is completely static and should be used as the 
 *  sole access point to IViewX backed classes (indicated by the ETIViewX prefix).
 *  
 *  There are a couple things worth noting when working with this class:
 *  - Concurrent access to the methods of this class has not been tested.
 *    It is advised to restrict the access to this classes functionality to 
 *    one thread at a time. Concurrent calls may lead to unknown behavior 
 *    on the eyetracking server side and could break your application.
 *  - While server access from multiple applications (different processes) is 
 *    officially supported according to the IViewX SDK documentation 
 *    (IView X SDK &gt;= 3.4.6, IView X Server &gt;= 2.11.65), it has not been tested.
 *  - This library and its documentation will be updated as the development team 
 *    gains new insight into the functionality of the SMI IView X SDK and the 
 *    IView X Server. Make sure you have the most recent version of the library 
 *    installed and check its documentation - There might have been some updates!
