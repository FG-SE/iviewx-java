/** The central access point to the part of the Eyetracking API which
 *  uses the SMI IView X Server for eyetracking data retrieval.
 *  <p>
 *  The IViewX class provides methods for connecting to the server, calibrating the 
 *  eyetracking device and validating the calibration results. To receive 
 *  eyetracking samples and events there are methods for getting a 
 *  ETSampleReceiver and a ETEventReceiver.
 *  <p>
 *  The interface of this class is completely static and should be used as the 
 *  sole access point to IViewX backed classes (indicated by the ETIViewX prefix).
 *  <p>
 *  There are a couple things worth noting when working with this class:
 *  <ul>
 *  	<li> 
 *  		The services provided by this class should only be used by
 *  		a single thread at a time. The SMI eyetracking library provides
 *  		a couple of abstractions that make it possible to work
 *  		concurrently with these services, but they too will only
 *  		use a single service on a single thread. If you pass any
 *  		of these services to multiple abstractions, or use it concurrently
 *  		from multiple threads, correct behavior is not guaranteed.
 *    	</li>
 *    	<li>
 *  		While server access from multiple applications (different processes) is 
 *    		officially supported according to the IViewX SDK documentation 
 *    		(IView X SDK &gt;= 3.4.6, IView X Server &gt;= 2.11.65), it has not been tested.
 *    	</li>
 *    	<li>
 *  		This library and its documentation will be updated as the development team 
 *    		gains new insight into the functionality of the SMI IView X SDK and the 
 *    		IView X Server. Make sure you have the most recent version of the library 
 *    		installed and check its documentation - There might have been some updates!
 *    	</li>
 *  </ul>
