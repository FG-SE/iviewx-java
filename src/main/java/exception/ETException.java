/** An exception that provides information on an eyetracker or
 *  eyetracking server related error.
 *  <p>
 *  This class serves as the base class for all other custom exceptions
 *  used by this library. Most of the thrown exceptions are specialized
 *  subclasses of this one, but some general errors are managed by this 
 *  class.
 *  <p>
 *  Since this class is the base class of all other custom exceptions, 
 *  you can effectively filter the errors by catching specific exceptions
 *  first and catch exceptions of type ETException as the last resort.
