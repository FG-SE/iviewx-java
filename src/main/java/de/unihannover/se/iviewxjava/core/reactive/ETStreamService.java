/** Asynchronously running service that publishes data
 *  in a reactive stream.
 *  <p>
 *  This service provides a powerful tool to work
 *  with data from a {@link ETReceiver} by leveraging
 *  the RxJava 2 library.
 *  <p>
 *  To use this service, simply {@link #start() start} it and
 *  subscribe to the reactive stream returned by
 *  {@link #getStream() getStream}.
 *  <p>
 *  If you want to stop the service, call {@link #stop() stop}.
 *  <p>
 *  The service runs asynchronously, so by default, subscriptions
 *  will subscribe on the service thread. It is advised to use
 *  <em>observeOn</em> in combination with a computational scheduler
 *  to make sure you don't block the service with your computations.
 *  Also you will have to keep backpressure in mind, since data
 *  might be produced at a very rapid rate. RxJava provides backpressure
 *  mechanisms (<em>onBackpressureLatest</em> is a great way to handle
 *  eyetracking data streams) to handle these kinds of situations.
 *
