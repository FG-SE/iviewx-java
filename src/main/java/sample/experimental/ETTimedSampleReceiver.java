/** Receives eyetracking samples from a ETSortedSampleList while simulating 
 *  a realtime eyetracker.
 *  <p>
 *  In contrast to the ETPlaybackSampleReceiver, this SampleReceiver returns 
 *  samples based on their actual timestamp. A internal timer is used to approximate 
 *  the elapsed time and return the appropriate eyetracking sample. If there are 
 *  timestamp-holes (no recorded data for a specific timestamp), the eyetracking with 
 *  the next-higher timestamp will be used until the timer has caught up.
 *  <p>
 *  This SampleReceiver has to be reset right before starting to poll eyetracking 
 *  samples. Resetting resets the internal timer, aswell as the list iteration, 
 *  so you can easily loop over a pre-recorded eyetracking sample data multiple times, 
 *  for example for live demonstrations.
 *  <p>
 *  Resetting this SampleReceiver and performing additional operations, before starting 
 *  to poll eyetracking samples can result in skipped samples. Make sure to call the 
 *  reset() method right before starting your poll-loop. This might change in a future 
 *  version of this library.
