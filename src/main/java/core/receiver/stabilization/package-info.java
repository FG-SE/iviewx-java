/** Contains classes for defining stabilization strategies.
 *   <p>
 *   A stabilization strategy is an algorithm for stabilizing the data
 *   returned by a {@link core.receiver.ETReceiver}. The eyetracking
 *   library uses the {@link core.receiver.stabilization.ETDefaultStabilizationStrategy}
 *   as the default strategy for all receivers created without a stabilization
 *   strategy.
