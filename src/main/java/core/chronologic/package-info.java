/** Contains classes for defining and managing chronologic objects.
 *  <p>
 *  Chronologic objects are objects, that can be chronologically compared.
 *  For eyetracking applications this would be a timestamp that
 *  indicates when the piece of data was recorded.
 *  <p>
 *  To define a chronologic object, you will have to create a class
 *  that implements the {@link core.chronologic.ChronologicComparable}
 *  interface. This class can then be used throughout the eyetracking
 *  library.
 *  <p>
 *  If you need to store chronologic objects in a collection that guarantees
 *  the chronologic order of the stored objects, take a look at
 *  {@link core.chronologic.ETChronologicCollection}.
